                    <p>Meta, a term with rich historical and contemporary connotations, serves as a prefix denoting a comprehensive or transcendent perspective. Its origins lie in Greek, where "meta" translates to "beyond" or "after," infusing modern contexts with layers of meaning. This multifaceted term finds applications across various domains, shaping our understanding and approaches to complex subjects.

                        In the realm of technology and social media, Meta has gained prominence as the rebranded name of Facebook Inc.</p>

                        Beyond its corporate rebranding, Meta encapsulates a broader philosophical and cultural movement towards understanding systems, processes, and phenomena from a higher-order perspective. In literary and artistic contexts, "meta" often signifies self-referential or self-aware works that explore the nature of the medium itself. Meta-narratives, meta-fiction, and meta-art challenge conventional boundaries, prompting audiences to reflect on the constructs and assumptions underlying creative expressions.
                        
                        In science and academia, the prefix "meta" plays a crucial role in denoting higher-order analyses and synthesizing knowledge across disciplines.</p>

                    <p>The high court’s decision to dismiss a plea for passive euthanasia by the parents of a 30-year-old Delhi resident who's been confined to the bed for the past 11 years has prompted criticism of how to deal with such cases

                        “While the court sympathises with the parents, as the petitioner is not terminally ill, this court cannot intervene and allow consideration of a prayer that is legally untenable.”
                        That’s what the Delhi high court said on July 8 while dismissing a plea by Harish Rana, a 30-year-old man, to undergo passive euthanasia. Harish suffered head injuries in 2013, and has been in a vegetative state since then.</p>

                    <p>Gautam Gambhir was appointed the new Indian cricket team head coach with Rahul Dravid's tenure coming to an end following the T20 World Cup 2024 triumph. Gambhir was the frontrunner to succeed Dravid for quite some time and his first assignment as head coach will be the upcoming T20I and ODI series against Sri Lanka. However, the appointment meant that Kolkata Knight Riders lost their mentor under whom they clinched the IPL 2024 title. There have been multiple reports that assistant coach Abhishek Nayar can join Gambhir in the Team India coaching staff and as a result, KKR are looking to revamp their coaching staff for the 2025 season. While Dravid was rumoured to be one of their choices, a report claims that KKR can be looking at legendary South Africa cricketer Jacques Kallis</p>
